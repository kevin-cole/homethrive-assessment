# HomeThrive Medication Manager Assignment

A POC medication management system built with SST (Serverless Stack) that allows caregivers to manage medications for care recipients. The system uses a file-based sql.js database with S3 synchronization for data persistence.

## Ruminations on project

- I decided to go with a more layman‚Äôs ui for medication dosing vs a medical professional ui, as my assumption is these will be entered after a script has been written, by the care giver who has read the more medical dosing and made it work for their loved one.
- I am skeptical of testing db functions, as my experience is you end up mocking everything to work. Adding an ORM that can type the db would be helpful. I did include on Jest test file for datetime.ts.
- I did not get around to implementing any examples, but it seems like a good place to test api calls.
- The concept of a "daily" schedule is just UI sugar, as all schedules are normalized to weekly schedules in the backend. The schedule type is saved in the on the medication record in case of future editing.
- Ad-hoc scheduling should be implemented for non-chronic medications that do not recur and dosing is finite (like antibiotics.) In these cases medication_times are not necessary and all dosing can be created immediately.
- Did a quick update to add a more mobile friendly view for most pages
- Spent more than a good while trying to implement with SST V3. I was unable to do it in the time allotted, so fell back to V2. V3 feels half-baked. I spoke with my colleague at Buildforce, and they are thinking of moving off SST altogether due to the lack of a good upgrade path
- Spent way too much time debugging different versions of file based mysql. Neither better-mysql or SQLLite works for SST (at least local development.) Settled on sql.js, though I did have to jump through hoops loading the sql-wasm.wasm file. I am not positive this code `this.SQL = await initSqlJs({
  locateFile: file => path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'sql-wasm.wasm'),
})` will work other than local dev, but this is not a production worthy infra.

## Known Issues

- **Mobile Only** - Medication add screen date picker does not work as expected.
- When your toke expires and you login again, initial redirect breaks and manual refresh is required

## üí° Key Features Explained

### Database Persistence Strategy

Instead of using AWS RDS or DynamoDB, this application uses a **file-based sql.js database**.
The database file is:

1. Stored in S3 for persistence
2. Downloaded to Lambda `/tmp/` on function startup
3. All operations performed on local file
4. Uploaded back to S3 after write operations

### Medication Scheduling

The system supports two recurrence types on he front end:

- **Daily**: Medication taken every day at the same time
- **Weekly**: Medication taken on specific days of the week

The scheduled doses are normalized to the same structure on the front end before persistence as (weekday, time) tuple.

When a medication is created:

1. Schedules are created based on recurrence patterns
2. Doses are generated for the next 7 days
3. TODO: add chron job to create doses
4. TODO: add method for determining possible doses into the future

I determined actual dosing persistence is only necessary to persist state (as in taken.) Future dosing can be extrapolated from the medication_times table and any given timeframe

### Dose Tracking

- Doses are created for 7 days currently synchronously on save.
- Caregivers can mark doses as taken
- System tracks overdue and upcoming doses
- TODO: move dose creating to an event based architecture

## üöÄ Deployment

### Backend Deployment

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

This creates:

- API Gateway with REST endpoints
- Lambda functions for each API route
- S3 bucket for database storage
- CloudFormation stack for resource management

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
cd packages/frontend
pnpm run build
```

The built files can be deployed to:

- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Any static hosting service

## üîí Security Considerations

- S3 bucket is private by default
- API Gateway provides built-in DDoS protection
- Lambda functions run in isolated environments
- No sensitive data stored in client-side code
